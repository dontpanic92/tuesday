<h4>Install the Apollo CLI</h4>

Ensure that `node` and `npm` are both installed, then run:

```bash
npm install --global apollo
```

This installs the CLI globally, but you can also install the CLI in your project's `devDependencies` and use it via [`npm-scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) or [`npx`](https://npm.im/npx).

<h4>Obtain a personal API key</h4>

If you haven't yet, [log in to Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com) and create a graph for your organization by clicking **New Graph** in the upper right.

Then go to your [Personal Settings page](https://studio.apollographql.com/user-settings) and obtain or create a new personal API key.

When you have your API key, add it to a `.env` file in the root directory of your project, like so:

```none:title=.env
APOLLO_KEY=user:gh.StephenBarlow:uB0sLhga7EemND1wTa6BcZ
```

**Do not add the `.env` file to version control.** It contains secrets that differ both per user and per environment.

When you execute Apollo CLI commands (such as to register a schema), the CLI obtains your API key from the `.env` file and uses it to authenticate with Studio.

<h4>Create an apollo.config.js file</h4>

Also in your project's root directory, create a file named `apollo.config.js`. The Apollo CLI uses configuration options in this file during the execution of various commands.

A basic `apollo.config.js` file looks like this:

```js
// apollo.config.js
module.exports = {
  service: {
    // Must match the name of your graph in Studio
    name: 'docs-example-graph',

    // EITHER THIS
    endpoint: {
      url: "http://localhost:4000"
    }
    // OR THIS
    localSchemaFile: './path/to/schema.graphql'
  }
};
```

To register your schema with Studio, the Apollo CLI needs to know how to access the schema. You can do this by providing either a `service.endpoint` object or a `service.localSchemaFile` string in `apollo.config.js`.

* If you provide an `endpoint` object, the CLI executes an introspection query on the GraphQL endpoint at the provided `url` to obtain your schema. To use this method, introspection must be enabled on your server.
* If you provide a `localSchemaFile` string, the CLI obtains your schema via the specified file path.

The [Apollo config documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/references/apollo-config/) has more details and advanced configuration options for the `apollo.config.js` format.
